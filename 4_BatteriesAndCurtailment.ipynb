    "# Using Batteries & Curtailment for Grid Flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use flexibility assets—specifically residential batteries and PV curtailment—to alleviate stress on a local electricity grid. The increasing adoption of photovoltaics (PV), heat pumps (HP), and electric vehicles (EVs) can lead to new grid challenges, such as cable overloads and voltage violations, especially during times of high solar generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of relying solely on expensive traditional grid reinforcement (i.e., replacing cables), we can use smart technologies to manage these new loads and generation sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Process:\n",
    "1.  **Analyze the Baseline:** We will select a substation and analyze its performance over a full year to identify any grid failures without any interventions.\n",
    "2.  **Deploy Batteries:** We'll implement a smart battery strategy where:\n",
    "    - Customers in weak parts of the grid get stricter export limits.\n",
    "    - Batteries are optimally sized for each customer to absorb excess solar energy.\n",
    "    - Batteries discharge to increase customer self-consumption.\n",
    "3.  **Apply Curtailment:** As a final step, we will apply PV curtailment to handle any rare, extreme events that the battery cannot fully mitigate.\n",
    "4.  **Compare Results:** We will compare the \"before\" and \"after\" scenarios to quantify the improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Setup: Loading Data and Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we load all necessary libraries and datasets. This includes the grid topology, yearly load profiles for consumption, PV, EVs, and HPs, and the costs for grid reinforcement.\n"

    "### Baseline Results Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen above for station `Station_1`, the analysis identifies multiple **link failures**. These are primarily due to `REVERSE_POWER_FLOW`, which occurs when many households with PV panels export large amounts of solar power back to the grid simultaneously, overloading the local cables.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 3. Solution Design: Battery and Curtailment Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll now define the functions that model our flexibility solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Strategy\n",
    "1.  **Dynamic Export Limits:** Instead of a single export limit for everyone, we'll assign a stricter limit (`1.5 kW`) to customers located on grid branches that experienced failures. Customers on stronger parts of the grid get a more generous limit (`5.0 kW`). This targets the solution where it's needed most.\n",
    "2.  **Optimal Battery Sizing:** For each customer with PV, we'll calculate the smallest battery needed to absorb most of their excess solar energy, respecting their dynamic export limit.\n",
    "3.  **Smart Battery Control:** The battery will:\n",
    "    - **Charge** using excess solar power that would have otherwise breached the export limit.\n",
    "    - **Discharge** to cover the home's own evening consumption, reducing grid imports and increasing self-sufficiency.\n",
    "4.  **PV Curtailment:** A final \"safety net\" to clip any power peaks that even the battery cannot handle (e.g., if the battery is already full).\n",

    "### Definitive Results and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The final analysis confirms that the combination of batteries and a minimal amount of curtailment creates a robust, failure-free grid. The amount of energy curtailed is negligible, showing that the batteries did almost all of the heavy lifting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this notebook has demonstrated:\n",
    "1.  **A Problem:** High PV penetration can cause reverse power flow issues on local grids.\n",
    "2.  **An Intelligent Solution:** By using dynamic export limits based on grid topology, we can strategically deploy flexibility assets.\n",
    "3.  **Effective Tools:** Optimally-sized residential batteries are highly effective at absorbing excess solar generation for later use, solving the vast majority of grid problems.\n",
    "4.  **A Reliable Backstop:** PV curtailment can act as a final, low-impact measure to guarantee grid stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data-driven approach allows grid operators to integrate more renewable energy sources efficiently and cost-effectively, deferring or avoiding expensive physical upgrades."
